## Data-cleaning-process
This repo is based on Excel's most common method for data cleaning.

 First, I have to do the autofit for the whole file. Home->format--> autofit.
* 2nd I have to do is lowercase in client data. create new column-->then add formula proper(lowercase()), then I have copied this client value, then paste as value.
* Now I have to trim the contact data to remove the unnecessary space. We can use a proper formula.
* Now I have to remove the duplicate value. Select data --> Data Tab-->Right of text to column, remove duplicates.
